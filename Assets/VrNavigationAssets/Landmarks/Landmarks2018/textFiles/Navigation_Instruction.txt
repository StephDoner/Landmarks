NAVIGATION

You will be asked to find each target store in the environment.
Once the current goal notification disappers, explore the 
environment until you find the current target store. You will receive
a notification when you come close enough to the current target.

There is no time limit. You must remember and locate the
current target before you may continue to the next trial/task.

Press [Return] when you are ready to begin.
