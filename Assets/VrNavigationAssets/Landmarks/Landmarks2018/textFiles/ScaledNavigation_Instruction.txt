Point To Navigate

You will be asked to find each target store in the scale environment, 
which can be found on a table in the virtual room.
Once the current goal notification disappers, us the mouse or pointing device
to guide the avatar to the current target store. When the avatar comes into 
contact with the target store, you will receive a notification. 

There is no time limit. You must remember and locate the
current target store before you may continue to the next trial/task.

Press [Return] when you are ready to begin.
