Imagined Navigation

You will now mentally simulate navigating to the {0}. If you just found the 
{0}, please simulate the same route you took to arrive there from the preceeding
target. If the last target you found was not the {0}, please simulate navigating
to the {0} from your current location.

When you are at your imagined starting point and ready to simulate your route, press 
the button to continue. When you arrive at the {0}, press any button to continue 
the experiment.
