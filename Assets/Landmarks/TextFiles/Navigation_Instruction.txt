NAVIGATION

You will be asked to find each of the targets in the environment.

A prompt will indicate the current target destination, followed by
a confidence judement of your ability to find that target. 

Explore the environment until you find the current target. You will
receive another prompt when you arrive at the correct destination.

There is no time limit, so you will need to locate the current 
destination before continuing on to the next trial or task.
