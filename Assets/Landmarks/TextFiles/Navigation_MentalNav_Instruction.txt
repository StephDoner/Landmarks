NAVIGATION + IMAGINED NAVIGATION

You will be asked to find each of the targets in the environment.

A prompt will indicate the current target destination, followed by
a confidence judement of your ability to find that target. 

Explore the environment until you find the current target. You will
receive another prompt when you arrive at the correct destination. 
There is no time limit, so you will need to locate the current 
destination before continuing.

After arriving at the target destination, you will be asked to re-imagine
your route to that destination from your previous starting point. On some 
trials, imagined navigation may begin immediately after the confidence 
judgement, requiring you to imagine navigating to the destination from 
your current position at that time. 

In either case, there is no time limit for the imagined navigation route. 
After imagined navigation, you will provide estimates for the presence and 
detail of your experience.
