Scaled Navigation

You will be asked to find each of the targets in a scaled model of the environment.

A prompt will indicate the current target destination, followed by
a confidence judement of your ability to find that target. 

Using an avatar in the environtment, explore the environment until 
you find the current target. You will receive another prompt when 
your avatar arrives at the correct destination.

There is no time limit, so you will need to locate the current 
destination before continuing on to the next trial or task.
