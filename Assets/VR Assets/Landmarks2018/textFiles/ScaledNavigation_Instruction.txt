Scaled Navigation

You will be asked to find each of the targets in the scaled environment.
The scaled environment will be on a table in the center of the virtual room.
A notification will indicate the current target you must find. Guide your avatare
through the environment until you find the current target. You will receive
a notification when the avatar is within a detectable proximity to the target.

There is no time limit. You must remember and locate the
current target before you may continue to the next trial/task.
