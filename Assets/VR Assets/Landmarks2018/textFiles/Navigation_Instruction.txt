NAVIGATION

You will be asked to find each of the targets in the environment.
A notification will indicate the current target you must find. Explore the
environment until you find the current target. You will receive
a notification when you are within a detectable proximity to the target.

There is no time limit. You must remember and locate the
current target before you may continue to the next trial/task.
