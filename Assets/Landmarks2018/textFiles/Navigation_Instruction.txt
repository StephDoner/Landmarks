NAVIGATION

You will be asked to find each target store in the environment.
Once the current goal notification disappers, explore the 
environment until you find the current target store. Walk
toward the store until you see the 'store found' notification.

There is no time limit. You must remember and locate the
current target store before you may continue.

Press [Return] when you are ready to begin.
